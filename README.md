# photo-dash

![Example deployment][.header]


## Overview

The `photo-dash` project is a series of modules and an endpoint. This repository specifically is the endpoint which sends images to a dumb digital photo frame.

Each module should be named like so: `photo-dash-module`. Each module should send a put request to the REST API to create or update images. The data format for these images is documented [here](docs/DATA.md).

Although this project focuses on a specific, generic frame ([Leed's] 1690-32BK), it may be possible to adapt the configurations for other dumb digital photo frames. This photo frame in particular has a full SD card slot and a USB A input slot. Both serve only as storage inputs; the frame cannot interact directly with a computer. More specifications are below; use them to adapt other frames for the project as necessary.

Similarly, this project focuses on a SBC ([Raspberry Pi Zero W][RPIZ]) to serve as the endpoint. It will connect to the photo frame via USB A (using its `USB` micro USB out plug) and act as a mass storage device. This [guide][USBGUIDE] from [the Raspberry Pi Foundation][RPI] is very helpful for setting up a USB (OTG) gadget to simulate a flash drive.

**Although not required, I recommend using the guide and this setup for the project.** I also recommend creating a data-only cable (details in the guide), as it means the SBC can be run independently of the photo frame. Also, because this is an endpoint to automatically generate images, you do not need to follow step 11 (Samba setup) in the guide.

## 1690-32BK Specifications

### Images

- Resolution: 480x234
- PNG is not supported *(tested: transparent PNG, JPG)*.
- Images that show are centered on both axes.
- Images smaller than the given resolution aren't scaled, so they are letterboxed on both axes if applicable.
- Images slightly larger than the given resolution *(tested: 1000x1000)* will be scaled down and fitted in full, regardless of aspect ratio. For example, given the 1000x1000 image (aspect ratio 1:1), its resulting image will appear as 480x234 (aspect ratio 80:39 or approximately 2:1).
- Images much larger than the given resolution *(tested: 12000x1000)* will be ignored and not shown. It is unclear whether image resolution or file size (or both) are responsible for this mechanism. Regardless, large images cannot work.

#### Fixes

- Images must be JPG. If your frame supports other extensions, feel free to change this in `photo_dash.image.DashImg.create`; the line is `self.dest = config.DEST / f'{self.module}.jpg'`.
- Images output from `photo_dash.image.DashImg` will be constrained to the resolution configured (default: 480x234).
- The visible area is a little reduced from its expected image resolution, probably due to the underlying display being partially obscured. To compensate for these cut borders, `photo_dash.image.DashImg` has two attributes that change offset from the outer edge: `H_SPACER` (horizontal) and `V_SPACER` (vertical).

### Functionality

- On boot, if no images are loaded, the photo frame will display a kind of boot screen. After at least one image has been shown, the boot screen will never show until rebooted.
- A slideshow option is available by default. This is required for full functionality, even when not using the exact photo frame.
- Directories are supported. However, `photo_dash.image.DashImg` will not use these unless specified as the destination. Empty directories are skipped.
- FAT32 (for the USB gadget) is well supported, but other file systems have not been tested.
- Images stay in memory on the photo frame. As a result, if the endpoint's USB gadget encounters an issue, the images on the photo frame may not be up-to-date. Because of this limitation, you cannot visually debug problems with the endpoint if images are shown.
- During `sync`s (especially if the recommended watchdog from the [guide][USBGUIDE] is installed), the photo frame may display no images or the settings/overview screen. This transition should only last a couple seconds.

#### Fixes

- If you are using the guide (specifically the kernel module `g_mass_storage`), in order for the endpoint to properly work after a reboot, I recommend adding the `modprobe` command (without `modprobe`) from the guide into a separate file under `/etc/modules-load.d`. Otherwise, you may have to manually update the kernel module (`g_mass_storage`).
- The USB gadget must be FAT32 to avoid any unforeseen problems. The guide mounts the simulated storage as FAT32.
- Because FAT32 storage does not support sym-linking, files must be copied over or directly written to storage. Specify the output directory in the configuration.
- The output directory in the configuration should point to the root of the mounted volume. If you have followed the guide linked above, this should be `/mnt/usb_share`. Although directories are supported, their behavior has not been tested (specifically, display order).
- Regarding images staying in memory, consequently when quiet hours are enabled and active, images from the last update will still be present. To mitigate this issue (or rather, make its quiet hours status known) when the frame may be on, you may run [utils_runner.py](utils_runner.py). See [Usage](#usage) for more details.

## Image Caveats

- The font must be monospace. It is difficult to determine pixel width in a non-monospace font, and sections become unwieldy to calculate without assuming monospace. If you replace the font, create a test image with the maximum number of characters per line with the font size `SECTION_SIZE` (in `photo_dash.image.DashImg`) and change `SECTION_CHAR`.
- Another reason why a monospace font is required: When rendering gauges, some numbers may be omitted if they cannot be rendered without obscuring an existing number. Since gauge markers are sorted from lowest to highest and their anchors are mid-aligned, each marker must check how far it is from its closest left neighbor (with half of its neighbor's width calculated). If the marker does not have enough space, it will not be rendered. Gauge values are also subject to this (including space from its nearest right neighbor), although gauge value lines will still be rendered regardless.

## Usage

1. Setup [config.json](config.json.example) by copying the example file and renaming it. `"width"` and `"length"` must be integers. `"destination"` must be a string that can be parsed as a path using `pathlib.Path`. (Both relative and absolute paths can work here.)
2. Run [photo_dash/app.py](photo_dash/app.py), preferably with `gunicorn` (provided in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)). The endpoint does not do anything on its own; use modules to send data to convert to a `photo-dash` image.
3. (Optional) Run [utils_runner.py](utils_runner.py) for extra utilities. Currently, this includes creating an image with text that describes quiet hours when in effect. The script should be run in background, preferably with any init system provided by the operating system.

After everything has been set up, I recommend setting firewalls to restrict external access. Preferably, use something like `ufw` and restrict incoming connections to a subnet or even individual addresses.

## Requirements

This code is designed around the following:

- Python 3.7+
    - `flask` and `flask-restful` for creating an API endpoint
    - `gunicorn` to run the endpoint
    - `pendulum` to determine when an image is created from data
    - `pillow` for creating dash images
    - other [requirements](requirements.txt)

## Setup

Make sure to fill in all the fields in [config.json](config.json.example).

- `"width"`: integer; width of the digital photo frame display, in pixels
- `"length"`: integer; length of the digital photo frame display, in pixels
- `"destination"`: string; must be a valid path (relative or absolute) that can be parsed by `pathlib.Path`

Optional configuration:

- `"quiet_start"`: integer; when quiet hours should start; requests (except for `GET` `QuietHours`) will not be fulfilled during this time
- `"quiet_end"`: integer; when quiet hours should end; requests will resume

âš  If you intend to use quiet hours, both quiet hours fields must be defined and not also be the same as each other. You cannot define only one field.
