# Data Format

## Summary

The data JSON has a specific format with data represented in `"sections"`. It always contains the name of the module (`"module"`) and title of the data (`"title"`). Each section must contain its [type](#type), [color](#color), and [value](#value), although these contents may slightly differ. Some sections must also require additional fields.

For more information, view the [example.json](../resources/example.json). The example contains values similar to the accepted values. [example.jpg](../resources/example.jpg) is the rendered image equivalent of the JSON and should serve as a reference.

## Format

### "module"

This is the name of the module and should be in the format `photo-dash-module`, but the format is not enforced. This only serves as the file name of the generated image.

### "title"

The title should be representative of the [data](#sections), not necessarily the [name](#module) of the module; it will be present, aligned left, at the top-left of the resulting image, as a header.

### "sections"

Sections are elements that fit between the header ([title](#title)) and the footer (date and time). They are created in the order they're read, aligned left, so the first sections begin near the top-left and continue down, aligned to the left border. Every section must contain a [type](#type) and [color(s)](#color). Each section is spaced vertically given the attribute `SPACER` in `photo_dash.image.DashImg`.

## An individual section, in detail

### "type"

The following types are valid:

- `"text"`: e.g. a sentence or heading
- `"gauge"`: two lines, representing a range/gauge (a line graph);
    - the top line contains [markers](#range) that correspond to the gauge plus its [reading](#value)
    - the bottom line contains the gauge with each partition colored sequentially with each partition corresponding to a marker

### "color"

Colors are in the format `#RRGGBB` and will fill the element in that color.

- If the element is a gauge, `"color"` must be a list of strings, even if only 1 partition is available; the number of colors must be 1 below the number of elements in `"range"`.
- Otherwise, this must only be a string.

### "range"

**This only applies to gauge elements.** A range should be a list of sorted numbers, with the minimum being the leftmost end while the maximum is the rightmost. All other numbers in the middle serve as markers and color partitions.

âš  **Although the list can be unsorted, note that the program will sort the list destructively. This may negatively affect the color assignment per range.**

### "value"

- If the [element](#type) is text, this is the text itself.
- If the [element](#type) is a gauge, this represents the reading within a [range](#range). A gray line will indicate this value within the gauge and may be labeled with the value, provided that the number doesn't obscure any of the range markers. The value number, if rendered, will have a gray outline to indicate its relation to the gauge.
